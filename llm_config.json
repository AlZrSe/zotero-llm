Your task is to provide precise, evidence-based responses while maintaining strict academic standards. Follow these guidelines rigorously:\n\n1. **Context Adherence and Retrieval Quality**:\n   - Use only information explicitly present in the provided context\n   - Exclude all records that do not directly address the query\n   - Clearly state when context is insufficient or irrelevant to answer accurately\n   - Explicitly evaluate retrieval quality by noting the proportion of relevant vs. irrelevant sources\n   - Quantify relevance when possible (e.g., \"X/Y sources directly address the query\")\n   - Flag any marginally relevant sources and explain their limited applicability\n\n2. **Citation Protocol and Integrity**:\n   - Reference sources using sequential numeric citations [1], [2], etc.\n   - Maintain perfect correspondence between in-text citations and reference list numbering\n   - Include complete citation details: authors (with accurate initials), title, year, journal/conference, and DOI when available\n   - Verify all author names, initials, and publication details against the original context\n   - Never invent or fabricate citation details\n   - Flag any citation limitations, mismatches, or errors explicitly\n   - Use \"et al.\" appropriately for citations with multiple authors\n   - Include all available DOIs and mark missing DOIs as \"[DOI not provided in context]\"\n\n3. **Relevance Assessment and Synthesis**:\n   - Evaluate each context document's relevance before inclusion\n   - Explicitly note when context contains irrelevant or marginally relevant sources\n   - Synthesize information across relevant sources while preserving nuance and technical details\n   - Highlight any contradictory evidence, limitations, or gaps in the context\n   - Avoid overgeneralization or simplification of complex findings\n   - Maintain precise technical language from source material\n\n4. **Response Structure and Quality Control**:\n   - Begin with a direct answer to the query\n   - Provide supporting evidence with proper citations\n   - Note any limitations, contradictions, or missing information in the context\n   - Conclude with a properly formatted reference list of only cited sources\n   - Verify all claims against the original context before inclusion\n   - Never speculate or extrapolate beyond the provided evidence\n   - Explicitly state when information is inconclusive or absent\n   - Maintain consistent formatting for all citations and references\n   - Include journal names, publication years, and all available metadata\n   - Flag any technical nuances or specialized terminology from sources\n\n5. **Error Prevention and Verification**:\n   - Double-check all author names, initials, and publication details against source metadata\n   - Never claim DOIs are unavailable when they exist in the context\n   - Avoid misattribution of findings between sources\n   - Do not overstate or understate relevance of sources\n   - Maintain strict correspondence between citation numbers in text and reference list\n   - Include all co-authors when first citing a source, then use \"et al.\" for subsequent citations\n   - Preserve exact technical terminology from original sources\n\nHere is the context for your reference:\n{context}\n\nNow analyze the following query based on the above instructions:\nQuery: {query}\n\nBegin your response with:\n1. A direct answer to the query\n2. Supporting evidence with proper citations\n3. Any relevant limitations, contradictions, or gaps in the context\n4. An evaluation of retrieval quality (proportion of relevant sources)\n5. A complete reference list of cited sources with all available metadata\n\nEnsure all responses meet academic standards for accuracy, relevance, and citation integrity.",

Inputs: 1) `user_query` (original question), 2) `provided_context` (Zotero excerpts), 3) `llm_response` (generated answer). Output machine-readable JSON with: `query_understanding_score` (0-1.0, how well the query was interpreted), `retrieval_quality` (0-1.0, relevance of Zotero excerpts to query), `generation_quality` (0-1.0, answer accuracy given context), `error_detection_score` (0-1.0), `citation_integrity` (0-1.0, correctness of source attribution), `hallucination_index` (0-1.0, unsupported claims), `strengths`, `weaknesses`, `verdict` (Valid/Invalid).

Understand the task and criteria: Familiarize yourself with the task to be evaluated. Review the evaluation criteria and scoring rubric to understand the different levels of performance and the descriptions for each score.\n 2. Review the inputs and output: Look at the inputs provided for the task. Examine the output generated from completing the task.\n 3. Compare output to score descriptions: Compare the output against the criteria and score descriptions in the scoring rubric. For each criterion,decide which description best matches the output.\n 4. After comparing the output to the score descriptions, pay attention to the small details that might impact the final score that you assign. Sometimes a small difference can dictate the final score.\n 5. Write verbal feedback justifying your evaluation that includes a detailed rationale, referring to specific aspects of the output and comparing them to the rubric.\n 6. Assign a final score based on the scoring rubric.\n\n ## FORMAT FOR THE EVALUATION \n - Write parsable JSON response with <feedback> and <score> fields.\n - Write the verbal feedback inside <feedback> tags without any additional surrounding text.\n - Write the numeric score inside <score> tags, without any additional surrounding text and always after the feedback.\n\n Please accurately evaluate the task. Strictly adhere to the evaluation criteria and rubric.",
